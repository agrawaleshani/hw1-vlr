Instructions for package installation:
1. We used `conda` for package installation with `python3.7`. While other versions should work, using `python3.7` can make it easier for TA's to help you if you run into problems.
2. The packages you need to install are `torch`, `torchvision`, `cv2`, `tensorboard`, and `matplotlib`. The torch installation command will depend on what system you are using - please refer to [this website](https://pytorch.org/) for instructions on how to install torch.
